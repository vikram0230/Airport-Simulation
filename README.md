# Airport Simulation

Airport Simulation utilizes the SimPy library to model and simulate airport operations, allowing for analysis and optimization of passenger flow and resource allocation.

## Features

- Simulates the processes of passenger entry, ticket verification, and security checks.
- Provides average wait times for passengers and different stages of the airport journey.
- Allows customization of the number of guards, airline representatives, and security lines.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vikram0230/airport-simulation.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install simpy
```

3. Run the simulation:

```
python airport.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the number of guards, airline representatives, and security lines.

5. Once the simulation is complete, average wait times and other relevant metrics will be displayed.

## Extending the Project

This project can be extended in various ways to further enhance its capabilities:

- Collect additional data during the simulation run and apply machine learning techniques for predictive modeling and optimization.
- Incorporate real-time data feeds to dynamically adjust resource allocation and queue management strategies.
- Implement additional features such as anomaly detection, passenger demand forecasting, or integration with airport management systems.
